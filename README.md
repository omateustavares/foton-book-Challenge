This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About the project

The objective of this project is to create a template that can be used to create projects using NextJS, as the process of installing and configuring libs at the beginning of a project can generate some complexity and often even errors that delay the process, interrupting the flow of development.

## Usage

Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
